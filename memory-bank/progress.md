# Progress & Status: Plutus Refactor & Enhancement - Initial A/B Comparison Done

## 1. Current Status

- **Phase:** Initial A/B Comparison (Source Code Analysis)
- **Overall Progress:** Memory Bank initialized. Initial A/B comparison based on file structure and key source files (`main.py`, `backtester.py`, `utils/analysts.py`, `llm/models.py`, agent/utility files related to differences) completed.

## 2. What Works / Completed

- **Memory Bank Core Files Created & Populated:**
    - `projectBrief.md`
    - `productContext.md`
    - `systemPatterns.md`
    - `techContext.md`
    - `activeContext.md` (Updated with comparison findings)
    - `progress.md` (This file)
- **Initial File Review:** Basic understanding gained from READMEs, dependency files, environment examples, etc.
- **Source Code Structure Comparison:** Compared `src/` directories.
- **Key Source File Comparison:** Analyzed differences in entry points, analyst configuration, LLM handling, and specific features (Ollama, Michael Burry agent).
- **Identified Key Differences:**
    - Ollama/Docker support in `../ai-hedge-fund` (absent in `plutus`).
    - Michael Burry agent in `../ai-hedge-fund` (absent in `plutus`).
    - Minor difference in backtester portfolio value calculation.
    - Tooling (`uv` vs. `poetry`) and Python version differences.

## 3. What's Left to Build / To Do

- **Present Findings:** Summarize the A/B comparison results for the user.
- **Plan Feature Integration:** Based on user feedback, detail the steps to integrate Ollama support and/or the Michael Burry agent into `plutus`, adhering to `plutus` standards (`uv`, Python 3.11+, coding style).
- **Git History Analysis (Targeted):** Perform `git log` analysis on specific files in `../ai-hedge-fund` if needed to understand the evolution of features targeted for integration.
- **Refactoring & Integration:** Implement the planned changes in `plutus`.
- **Apply Standards:** Run `ruff` and `mypy` on `plutus` after changes.
- **Testing Strategy:** Define and implement tests for `plutus`.

## 4. Known Issues / Blockers

- None currently. Awaiting user feedback on integration priorities.

## 5. High-Level Plan (Next Steps Recap)

1.  Present A/B comparison findings to the user.
2.  Discuss and plan the integration of desired features (Ollama, Michael Burry agent) into `plutus`.
3.  Proceed with implementation, ensuring adherence to `plutus` standards (`uv`, Python 3.11+, `ruff`, `mypy`).
