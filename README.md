This is a proof of concept for an AI-powered trading system. The goal of this project is to explore the use of AI to make trading decisions. This project is for **educational** purposes only and is not intended for real trading or investment.

This system employs several agents working together:

01. **Ben Graham Agent** - The godfather of value investing, only buys hidden gems with a margin of safety.
02. **Bill Ackman Agent** - An activist investor, takes bold positions and pushes for change.
03. **Cathie Wood Agent** - The queen of growth investing, believes in the power of innovation and disruption.
04. **Charlie Munger Agent** - Warren Buffett's partner, only buys wonderful businesses at fair prices.
05. **Peter Lynch Agent** - Legendary growth investor who seeks "ten-baggers" and invests in what he knows.
06. **Phil Fisher Agent** - Legendary growth investor who mastered scuttlebutt analysis.
07. **Stanley Druckenmiller Agent** - Macro legend who hunts for asymmetric opportunities with growth potential.
08. **Warren Buffett Agent** - The oracle of Omaha, seeks wonderful companies at a fair price.
09. **Valuation Agent** - Calculates the intrinsic value of a stock and generates trading signals.
10. **Sentiment Agent** - Analyzes market sentiment and generates trading signals.
11. **Fundamentals Agent** - Analyzes fundamental data and generates trading signals.
12. **Technicals Agent** - Analyzes technical indicators and generates trading signals.
13. **Risk Manager** - Calculates risk metrics and sets position limits.
14. **Portfolio Manager** - Makes final trading decisions and generates orders.

## Prerequisites

- **Python >= 3.11:** This project requires Python 3.11 or newer.
- **`uv`:** This project uses `uv` for environment and package management. Install it if you haven't already: [https://github.com/astral-sh/uv#installation](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv#installation)

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/shaneholloman/plutex.git
    cd plutex
    ```

2. **(Optional) Install Python 3.11+ using `uv`:**
    If you don't have a suitable Python version installed, you can install one managed by `uv`:

    ```sh
    # Example: Install Python 3.11
    uv python install 3.11
    # List available/installed versions
    uv python list
    ```

3. **Create and activate the virtual environment:**
    This command creates a `.venv` directory using the specified Python version (or a compatible one found by `uv`) and activates it.

    ```sh
    # Use the specific version you want (e.g., 3.11)
    uv venv --python 3.11
    source .venv/bin/activate
    # On Windows use: .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

4. **Install dependencies:**
    This installs all packages listed in `pyproject.toml` into your virtual environment.

    ```sh
    uv sync
    ```

5. **Set up environment variables:**
    Copy the example file and add your API keys.

    ```sh
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    Now, edit the `.env` file and replace the placeholder keys with your actual API keys:

    ```dotenv
    # .env file contents:
    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-api-key
    DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your-deepseek-api-key
    GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-api-key
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-api-key
    FINANCIAL_DATASETS_API_KEY=your-financial-datasets-api-key
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
    ```

    **Important**: You need to set the API key for at least one LLM provider (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GROQ_API_KEY`, `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`) for the application to work. You will be prompted to choose a model from the available providers when running the script.

    Financial data for AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT, NVDA, and TSLA is free via the Financial Datasets API. For any other ticker, you **must** set the `FINANCIAL_DATASETS_API_KEY`.

## Usage

Ensure your virtual environment is activated (`source .venv/bin/activate`).

### Running plutex

Run the main script, providing the required `--tickers` argument. You will be interactively prompted to select analysts and an LLM model.

```sh
# Basic run with specific tickers
python -m src.main --tickers AAPL,MSFT,NVDA

# Run with reasoning shown
python -m src.main --tickers AAPL,MSFT,NVDA --show-reasoning

# Run for a specific date range
python -m src.main --tickers AAPL,MSFT,NVDA --start-date 2025-01-01 --end-date 2025-03-01

# Run with specific initial cash (e.g., $50,000)
python -m src.main --tickers AAPL,MSFT,NVDA --initial-cash 50000

# Run with a specific margin requirement (e.g., 50%)
python -m src.main --tickers AAPL,MSFT,NVDA --margin-requirement 0.5

# Run and save the agent graph visualization (saves as [analyst_name(s)]_graph.png)
python -m src.main --tickers AAPL --show-agent-graph
```

**Example Output:** (Output format may vary)

```txt
python src/main.py --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA

| Cathie Wood | BEARISH  |        70.0% | While Apple is undeniably a technology leader with           |
|             |          |              | impressive scale and profitability, its current trajectory   |
|             |          |              | doesn't align with our core focus on disruptive innovation   |
|             |          |              | poised for exponential growth. The analysis indicates R&D    |
|             |          |              | investment sits at only 6.8% of revenue. For companies truly |
|             |          |              | shaping the future and creating new markets, we typically    |
|             |          |              | look for much more aggressive investment in breakthrough     |
|             |          |              | technologies – often exceeding 15-20%. While positive free   |
|             |          |              | cash flow and operating leverage are noted, these metrics    |
|             |          |              | reflect a mature, optimizing company rather than one on the  |
|             |          |              | cusp of exponential disruption. Apple appears focused on     |
|             |          |              | incremental improvements within its established ecosystem,   |
|             |          |              | lacking the clear, game-changing technological shifts or     |
|             |          |              | platform launches we seek that could unlock multi-fold       |
|             |          |              | growth from here. Furthermore, the current valuation         |
|             |          |              | suggests the market has already priced in significant        |
|             |          |              | success, potentially limiting the asymmetric upside          |
|             |          |              | potential we target over a 5+ year horizon. We need to see   |
|             |          |              | clearer evidence of investment in truly transformative areas |
|             |          |              | – like autonomous systems, next-generation AI integration    |
|             |          |              | beyond current capabilities, or novel hardware platforms –   |
|             |          |              | to become bullish on Apple as a core disruptive innovator    |
|             |          |              | for the next decade.                                         |

|             |          |              | Intelligence, particularly through its integration of        |
|             |          |              | generative AI like Copilot across its vast software suite.   |
|             |          |              | This positioning taps into enormous, expanding TAMs. We see  |
|             |          |              | evidence of their commitment to innovation with increasing   |
|             |          |              | R&D intensity, now at 13.5% of revenue, fueling advancements |
|             |          |              | in these key areas. Their impressive operating margins       |
|             |          |              | (38.9%) and consistent Free Cash Flow generation provide     |
|             |          |              | substantial resources to reinvest in maintaining             |
|             |          |              | technological leadership and scaling these innovations       |
|             |          |              | globally. However, the provided analysis indicates a         |
|             |          |              | significant valuation premium, with the market               |
|             |          |              | capitalization far exceeding calculated intrinsic value      |
|             |          |              | (-50.13% margin of safety). While we firmly believe          |
|             |          |              | traditional valuation metrics often underestimate the        |

|             |          |              | preferred 5+ year horizon, the current valuation demands a   |
|             |          |              | degree of caution. We remain watchful; Microsoft's AI        |

|             |          |              | new value streams. While the current signal is neutral based |
|             |          |              | on valuation metrics, its strategic positioning in AI and    |
|             |          |              | Cloud keeps it high on our conviction list, pending evidence |
|             |          |              | of AI adoption translating into accelerating growth that     |

|             |          |              | adoption we anticipate for AI compute over the next 5-10     |
|             |          |              | years. NVIDIA's consistent positive free cash flow fuels     |
|             |          |              | this innovation engine, allowing them to reinvest heavily in |

| Reasoning  | Strong bullish signal (85.0 confidence). Opening a long    |
|            | position. Buying the maximum allowed shares (183) as the   |
|            | total cost (183 * $109.12 = $19,948.96) is well within the |
|            | available portfolio cash ($100,000.00).                    |

Portfolio Strategy:
Bearish signal with 70.0 confidence. Opening a short
position. The quantity is capped at the max_shares guideline
(89) for risk management, treating it as a position size
limit. The margin requirement is 0.00, so margin
availability is not a constraint for this trade size
(Position Value: 89 * $222.57 = $19,808.73; Margin Used:
$0.00).
